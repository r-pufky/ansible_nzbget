###############################################################################
# PascalCase: nzbget_main_dir > MainDir.
#
# Do NOT use NZBGet config variable interpretation.

# Root directory for all tasks. Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads'.
nzbget_main_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads'

# Destination directory for downloaded files.
#
# Distinguish between partially downloaded files and completed downloads with
# nzbget_inter_dir.
#
# Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/completed'.
nzbget_dest_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/completed'

# Directory to store intermediate files.
#
# If set files are downloaded into this directory first. After successful
# download of nzb-file (possibly after par-repair) files are moved to
# nzbget_dest_dir. Failed download or unpacked files remain in intermediate
# directory.
#
# Using of intermediate directory can significantly improve unpack performance
# if you can put nzbget_inter_dir and nzbget_dest_dir on separate physical hard
# drives.
#
# Values:
#       '': downloaded files are put directly to nzbget_dest_dir
#   {PATH}: absolute path to intermediate directory
#
# Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/intermediate'
nzbget_inter_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/intermediate'

# Directory for incoming nzb-files.
#
# New nzb-files added to queue via web-interface or RPC-API, are saved into
# this directory and then processed by extension scripts nzbget_extensions.
#
# Directory is also monitored for new nzb-files. If a new file is found it is
# added to download queue. The directory can have sub-directories. A nzb-file
# queued from a subdirectory is automatically assigned to category with
# sub-directory-name.
#
# Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/nzb'
nzbget_nzb_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/nzb'

# Directory to store program state.
#
# Directory to save download queue, history, information about fetched RSS
# feeds, statistics, etc.
#
# Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/queue'
nzbget_queue_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/queue'

# Directory to store temporary files. Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/tmp'.
nzbget_temp_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/tmp'

# Directory with web-interface files.
#
# Values:
#       '': disables WebUI (JSON/XML/RPC requests still enabled)
#   {PATH}: WebUI source files (default)
#
# Default: '/usr/share/nzbget/webui'
nzbget_web_dir: '/usr/share/nzbget/webui'

# List of directories with post-processing and other scripts.
#
# Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/scripts'
#
# Reference:
# * https://nzbget.com/documentation/extension-scripts/.
nzbget_script_dir: '/var/lib/nzbget/scripts'

# Lock-file for daemon-mode.
#
# Values:
#   '': disable lock file and check for running instances (not recommended)
#   {PATH}: absolute path to lock file
#
# Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/nzbget.lock'
nzbget_lock_file: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/nzbget.lock'

# Logfile location. Default: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/nzbget.log'.
nzbget_log_file: '/var/lib/nzbget/downloads/nzbget.log'

# Configuration file template.
#
# NZBGet configuration templated used by WebUI to read option descriptions.
#
# Default: '/usr/share/nzbget/nzbget.conf'
nzbget_config_template: '/usr/share/nzbget/nzbget.conf'

# List of required directories before processing starts.
#
# The list of directories is checked on program start. The program waits until
# all directories become available before starting download or post-processing.
# This is useful if the download destination is configured on network or
# external drives, which may require some time to mount on boot.
#
# Special Case:
#   * Only nzbget_inter_dir, nzbget_dest_dir (and per category) can be waited
#
# Default: [] (disabled).
nzbget_required_dir: []

# Certificate store file or directory.
#
# Certificate store contains root certificates used for server certificate
# verification when connecting to servers with encryption (TLS/SSL). This
# includes communication with news-servers for article downloading and
# with web-servers (via https) for fetching of rss feeds and nzb-files.
#
# Certificate verification must be enabled separately via nzbget_cert_check.
#
# Values:
#   {PATH}: absolute path to directory containing certificate files
#   {FILE}: absolute path to big file containing all root certificates
#
# Default: '/usr/share/nzbget/cacert.pem'
#
# Reference:
# * https://nzbget.com/documentation/certificate-verification/.
nzbget_cert_store: '/usr/share/nzbget/cacert.pem'
