# Check and Repair
###############################################################################
# PascalCase: nzbget_par_check > ParCheck.

# Check CRC of downloaded and decoded articles?
#
# Typically enabled to detect download errors and for quick par verification
# nzbget_par_quick.
#
# Default: True.
nzbget_crc_check: true

# PAR verification actions.
#
# Values:
#     auto: PAR check is performed when needed. One PAR2 file is always
#           downloaded. Additional PAR2 files are downloaded if needed
#           for repair. Repair performed if nzbget_par_repair=true. (default)
#   always: check every download (even undamaged). One PAR2 file is always
#           downloaded. Additional PAR2 files are downloaded if needed for
#           repair. Repair performed if nzbget_par_repair=true.
#    force: force PAR check for every download (even undamaged). All PAR2 files
#           are always downloaded. Repair performed if nzbget_par_repair=true.
#   manual: PAR check is skipped. One PAR2 file is always downloaded. If a
#           damaged download is detected, all PAR2 files are downloaded but
#           neither PAR check nor PAR repair take place. The download can be
#           then repaired manually, eventually on another faster computer.
#
# Default: 'auto'.
nzbget_par_check: 'auto'

# Automatic PAR repair after PAR verification?
#
# Repair damaged files if nzbget_par_check 'auto' or 'force'. Repairing may
# consume too many resources and time on a slow computer.
#
# Default: True.
nzbget_par_repair: true

# Files scanned during PAR verification.
#
# Values:
#    limited: scan only files belonging to PAR set
#   extended: scan files belonging to PAR set first, scan other files until all
#             missing files are found. (default)
#       full: scan all files in destination directory. Can be very time
#             consuming but may sometimes repair where limited/extended fail.
#       dupe: scan files belonging to PAR set first, scan other files until
#             repair is possible. Even files from other duplicate-downloads are
#             scanned. Can be very time consuming but brings best results.
#
# Default: 'extended'.
nzbget_par_scan: 'extended'

# Quick file verification during PAR check?
#
# Files verified using checksums calculated during download comparing with
# checksums stored in PAR file (no disk reads).
#
# Default: True.
nzbget_par_quick: true

# Memory limit for PAR repair buffer (MB).
#
# Optimal size is total size of all damaged blocks. For best performance set
# to a few hundred MB's.
#
# Default: 100.
nzbget_par_buffer: 100

# Number of threads to use during PAR repair.
#
# Values:
#   0: automatically use all available CPU cores (default)
#   1: single-core CPUs use only one thread
#   *: number of physical cores + hyper-threading units; add 1-2 additional
#      threads to get 100% utilization accounting for wait intervals.
#
# Default: 0 (auto).
nzbget_par_threads: 0

# List of files to ignore during PAR check.
#
# If PAR rename or PAR check detect missing or damaged files they will ignore
# files matching this option and will not initiate repair. This avoids time
# costing repair for unimportant files.
#
# File extensions, file names or file masks.
#
# Special Case:
#   *?: wildcard and pattern matching allowed
#   .{EXT}: file extension
#   {FILE}: file
#
# Default: ['.sfv', '.nzb', '.nfo']
nzbget_par_ignore_ext: ['.sfv', '.nzb', '.nfo']

# Check for renamed and missing files using PAR files?
#
# PAR rename detects missing files and restores original file names using
# information stored in PAR2 files. First step of post-processing for every NZB
# file.
#
# Default: True.
nzbget_par_rename: true

# Check for renamed RAR files?
#
# RAR rename restores original file names using information stored in RAR
# files. First step of post-processing for every NZB file.
#
# RAR rename is useful for downloads not having PAR2 files or for downloads
# those files were renamed before creating PAR2 files. In both cases PAR rename
# nzbget_par_rename can't rename files and the RAR rename makes it possible to
# unpack downloads which would fail otherwise.
#
# Default: True.
nzbget_rar_rename: true

# Directly rename files during downloading?
#
# Similar to nzbget_par_rename but files renamed during downloading instead of
# post-processing stage. Works only for healthy downloads.
#
# Default: True.
nzbget_direct_rename: true

# Download critical health action.
#
# nzbget_dupe_check requires delete, park, or none. If nzbget_par_scan=dupe
# park performed only if article completion is below 10%; improves efficiency
# of dupe par scan mode.
#
# Values:
#   delete: delete NZB file from queue also delete already downloaded files
#     park: move NZB file to history, keep already downloaded files (default)
#    pause: pause NZB file
#     none: do nothing (continue download)
#
# Default: 'park'.
nzbget_health_check: 'park'

# Maximum allowed time for PAR repair (minutes).
#
# Cancel PAR repair if estimated value exceeds limit.
#
# Special Case:
#   =>5: checked after first 5 minutes when estimated time is more accurate
#    <5: checked after first minute
#     0: unlimited time (default)
#
# Default: 0 (unlimited).
nzbget_par_time_limit: 0

# Pause download queue during check/repair?
#
# Speed up check/repair for slow CPU's with a fast connection. Temporarily
# unpauses if additional PAR files are required. See nzbget_script_pause_queue
# and nzbget_unpack_pause_queue.
#
# Default: False.
nzbget_par_pause_queue: false
